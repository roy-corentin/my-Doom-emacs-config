#+title: PRESENTATION

    Here is my personal configuration for [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]], that I use daily
It needs to be improved and optimized to be more clear. I'm still working on it

* Emacs Compile Config
I compile emacs myself and I use those flags to improve the experience
 + ~--with-native-compilation~  To build natively
 + ~--without-x~ To build without any x toolkit
 + ~--with-pgtk~ To build with pure GTK (only for pure wayland user)
 + ~--with-json~ To build with a better support of json
 + ~--with-tree-sitter~ To build with tree-sitter (only for pure wayland user)
 + ~--with-mailutils~ To build with better support of mailutils

* Fix Emacsclient Tabs
Use the file ~tab_config.el~ to fix this issue

#+begin_src shell
cp ~/.doom.d/tabs_config.el ~/.emacs.modules.ui/tabs/config.el
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src shell
cp .config/doom/tabs_config.el .config/emacs/modules/ui/tabs/config.el
#+end_src

* Lsp Boost
To improve [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] install [[https://github.com/blahgeek/emacs-lsp-booster][emacs-lsp-booster]]
 It really works !!
